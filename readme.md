### Backend

Backend will be implement with MongoDB as database, running on ds056688.mongolab.com.

Mongoose will be used as ODM in this project. Only two schemas will be defined, one defining a fruit and the other one definig a basic user profile.

### Frontend

Jade template engine will be used for rendering views. Only one generic layout, one mixins file a an index page will be included.

Communication with model will be implemented with AJAX instead of a data factory or provider because of simplicity matters.
